## HOW I PLAN TO DO THIS

## Plans to make it more advanced
- Insert an API that generates words from an online dictionary rather than those that are preset
- Use Java FX and SceneBuilder to make it look nice
- Generate hangman drawings and sounds if answers are right or wrong

## Learning objectives 
- Do this then start again 
- Take the longest route to cover the most topics possible

## Completed
- Make an enum with some sample words
- Insert function to randomise them

## Incomplete

- Access the enum's individual letters
- Countdown for numbers of tries from 10 (If right what happens? If wrong what happens?)
- Display a "_ _ _ _ _" format and fill in the blanks as people guess right
- Generate the logic for what happens if you win or what happens if you lose

 ## Notes commit

  - 24/2/24 commit : You need to fix the if statements in the do while loop so that you get the desired results you need in the terminal. 
  continue reading the String Methods page on W3 schools to help you. Try and write out the logic of what you think the code is trying to do logically and change it to suit what you need.
