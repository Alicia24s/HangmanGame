## HOW I PLAN TO DO THIS

## Plans to make it more advanced
- Insert an API that generates words from an online dictionary rather than those that are preset
- Use Java FX and SceneBuilder to make it look nice
- Generate hangman drawings and sounds if answers are right or wrong

## Learning objectives 
- Do this then start again 
- Take the longest route to cover the most topics possible

## Completed
- Make an enum with some sample words
- Insert function to randomise them

## Incomplete

- Access the enum's individual letters
- Countdown for numbers of tries from 10 (If right what happens? If wrong what happens?)
- Display a "_ _ _ _ _" format and fill in the blanks as people guess right
- Generate the logic for what happens if you win or what happens if you lose
